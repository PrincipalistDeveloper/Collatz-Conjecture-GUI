## What is the Collatz Conjecture?
The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. It concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if a term is even, the next term is one half of it. If a term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence. The conjecture has been shown to hold for all positive integers up to 2.36Ã—1021, but no general proof has been found. [wikipedia]

## What does this program do?
This program is both entertainment and easy checking of any number. There is a graphing function to observe the magnifecent peaks of numbers and the randomness. A log feature is available to see how each number evolved. A checker is available to see if a collatz sequence is mathematically correct.

## This number is too big!
Due to the way computers work, it is a physical-technical limitation. Computers are designed to process numbers up to 10^308, any higher and it will be deemed as "Infinity". Additionally, the graphing function completely fails at values beyond 9223372036854775807.
